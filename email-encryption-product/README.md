## Setup

### CREATE SELF SIGNED S/MIME CERTIFICATE

First you will need to install OpenSSL on windows, and you can download it from here: [OpenSSL](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/openssl.htm) 

All the commands should be run from command prompt under the installation directory in BIN folder:

```

C:\OpenSSL-Win64\bin

```

First, letâ€™s create a self-sign certificate and a private authority valid for 365 days:

```

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout encrypted.email.key -out encrypted.email.crt -sha256 -days 365

```

Fill all the information in the wizard to create the certificate using the password for the private key

Now you have created self-signed certificate with the Private authority, but outlook, thunderbird and other email client use `p12` certificate style, so let's create this kind of certificate:

```

openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey encrypted.email.key -in encrypted.email.crt -out encrypted.email.p12

```

Enter the password you have created for the private key before. Now you have all the certificates you will need. To trust those certificates, you will need to install them on your email client.
